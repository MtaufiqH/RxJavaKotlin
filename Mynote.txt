Notes:
- There are three special types of Observable in RxJava:
    1. Singles, will emit either success (value) or error event. success(values) is actually
       a combination of the next and completed events. this useful for one time processes.
    2. Completable, will only emit a complete or error event, and it doesn't emit any value.
    3. Maybe, combination from Single and Completable, will emit either success (values) or error event.
